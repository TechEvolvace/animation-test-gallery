# Animation Test Gallery

## What's it about? 
This is a testing ground website that will showcase all potential advanced animations created with CSS and JavaScript! Similar to my buttons-function testing
ground website, each animation will be assigned to their respecitve experiment page where they will each show the animation, the code, and the findings I found when developing them! 

## New Exciting Features!

### The Landing Page 
The landing page (the webpage where this repository's deployed URL will take the user to) will be this project's de-facto homepage that will show a brief glimpse at each of the animations that I have finished creating!
* <span style="color:lightgreen">Home page will first **load up an animated welcome message (that will last around 5 seconds) only once** before reverting to its de-factor default appearance of this project's home page</span>, which is the gallery of all the animations that I have finished creating! 
* <span style="color:lightgreen">Each animation is displayed in its own "experiment" card</span> where the experiment cards will be a 3 x 3 grid structure for large browser viewport widths (greater than 550px, which includes sizes of iPads, laptops, and desktop screens) and a 1 x 1 vertical column for small browser widths (less than or equal to 550 px, equivalent to a small phone screen)
* <span style="color:lightgreen">Each card **when not clicked on** will show a small video of the animation (a preview of the actual animation), the title for the animation, and a "View Animation" button</span>
  * <span style="color:orange">When the "View Animation" button is clicked, then it will take to the unique page containing the animation in its full size!</span>
* <span style="color:lightgreen">**When the card is clicked on**, a larger card appears with the following features</span>:
  * A larger video of the animation (the same video that appears in the small card earlier) occupying the larger card's left half 
  * Title of the animation, experiment number (experiment ID), description about the animation, and a "View Animation" button that when clicked will load to the unique page containing the animation in its full size! 

### The Animation's Unique Page 
This is the page that will show the animation (not as a video) in its full form! 
* Header/Navbar
  * The header will have an animation title (maybe also have the "experiment number") and a navbar of unique icons 
  * The navbar have the following features:
    <span style="color:lightblue">
    * View Code 
    * View Findings
    * Return to Gallery (Goes back to the landing page, which will not show the opening welcome message again until the user reenters the website from the 
    deployed URL)! 
    </span>
  * The animation will be shown below the header section!
