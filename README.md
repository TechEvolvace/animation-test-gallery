# Animation Test Gallery

## What's it about? 
This is another of my testing ground websites to showcase all potential advanced animations created with CSS and JavaScript! Similar to my buttons-function-testing ground website, there will be experiments where they will each show the animation, the code, and the findings I found. 

## New Features
There will be a home page to showcase mini-versions of experiments for the user to select from that will take to the individual experiment!
